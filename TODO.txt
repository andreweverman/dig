At end:
    Token refresh works. Need to put in right spots and also assign the token to the user

    Need to make dig document in MongoDB for each user. 

    Setup Master optional param for the enable_dig


12/16: Thoughts for today:

    The refresh token button works and the user gets the new access token.

    Things to do from here: 
        
        *Make a scheduler go through each user and refresh their token and put it in db.

        Get Dig Table set up for MongoDB

12/30: 

    Try to not need to lookup the mongoose again

    File management better !
