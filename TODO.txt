    views:

        disable service button working

        need some jquery to get the services to hot reload every time

        add routes and views for edit and disable services
            edit service should list as primary the current dig playlist


Working on currently: 

    only show playlists that we own in enable_dig

    use put request instead of post.

    disable service button
