<h1> Dig</h1>
<p> "Dig" takes the recently most saved tracks and making a small playlist of just those tracks
    <br> It automatically keeps updated in the background so you don't have to think about it.
</p>
<h3>Dig will need a playlist to write into
</h3>


<h3>Choose an exsisting playlist to become dig:</h3>

<form id="dig_credentials" action="">
    <select id="dig_select" multiple size="<%=playlists.length%>">
        <% playlists.forEach(list => { %>
        <option value="<%=list.id%>"> <%=list.name%></option>
        <%});%>

    </select>
    <br>
</form>

<button class="btn btn-default" id="submit_dig">Submit</button>
